PDP-11 operating systems

This is largely a legacy repository of PDP-11 operating systems produced and marketed by HAMMONDsoftware in Germany in the 1980, 
which I continue to develop, including including adding a Windows-based PDP-11 emulator environment. My plan is to slowly clean
up the source/binary directories and move them one at a time to the repository, along with the binaries and installation kits.
