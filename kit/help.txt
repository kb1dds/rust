I set up a RUST wiki at wikispaces.com, but it's long since gone.
This document is provided in lieue until I reconstruct the wiki
here on GitHub (GitHub has a learning curve in everything).

You can also use RUST HELP when running under RUST (it's the same
information). VT100 mode support is only rudimentary however.

/AUTO

  Automates driver installation.

  Each RT-11 driver checks to see if it can run on a given machine.
  With /AUTO a driver is only installed or loaded if that check succeeds.
  No error message is displayed if the installation check fails.

  You use this option to automatate the system setup process:

  .load/auto ei                ! install EIS emulator if required
  .load/auto dd,dl,du,rk       ! load if present

/LOG

  Reports the name of the device driver selected for installation.

  Probing a device provides further installation checks by testing
  to see if the device is on-line and is identifiable. Most drivers
  ignore this option. System drivers are not probed during bootstrap.

  The default is /NOPROBE except for /AUTO.

  The TU58 DECtape II tape drive can only be identified by sending
  an INIT message. The examples below enumerate the options:

  .install dd:              ! does not probe
  .install/probe dd:        ! probes the TU58
  .install/auto dd:         ! probes the TU58

    A set of device-driver configuration items    


SET KMON [NO]IND

  Command files are (not) passed to IND for interpretation.
  The default is /NOIND - DCL interprets command files.

SET PROGRAM image

  Fixes up the way some programs execute with RUST/XM.

  Some programs have minor problems running in a mapped, network environment.
  The operations described here solve most of the usual problems.

  You should read the names of the options here as "the LOOP fixup" or the
  "NOTRACE fixup".

  In-file
    An input file specification.

  Use SHOW PROGRAM to examine the settings.

SET PROGRAM/[NO]CTRLF

  /CTRLF: CTRL-B and CTRL-F are passed to the program.

  /NOCTRLF: CTRL-B and CTRL-F switch processes. The default.

  Some programs (including LEX) use these control keys themselves.

SET PROGRAM/[NO]CTRLT

  /CTRLT: CTRL-T is passed to the program.        

  /NOCTRLT: CTRL-T displays process status. The default.

  See (would you believe) SET TERMINAL/HALFDUP.

  In neither case is CTRL-Y passed to the program.

SET PROGRAM/[NO]CTRLZ

  /CTRLZ: CTRL-Z as a treated line terminator.

  /NOCTRLZ: CTRL-Z is usually nothing special.

  Some programs (many with an RSX history) like to treat CTRL-Z as a line
  terminator or end of file.

SET PROGRAM/[NO]FPU

  /FPU: Includes FPU information in context switchs.

  /NOFPU: FPU information is not context switched. The default.

  Programs are supposed to issue .SFPA if they use the FPU. But on a single-
  user system without context switching it is easy to forget. Try this if your
  floating point numbers look wrong.

SET PROGRAM/[NO]IOPAGE

  Does (not) map the PDP-11 I/O page for the program.

  /IOPAGE:        Maps the PDP-11 I/O page for the program.
  /NOIOPAGE:      The I/O page is not mapped. The default.

  o The program needs CMKRNL rights.
  o Some programs required SET PROGRAM/LIMIT=28 for this option.

SET PROGRAM/JSW=octal

  Deposits a (octal) value in the image Job Status Word.  

  This option provides a simple way of patching a program.

SET PROGRAM/[NO]MMU

  Sets the program MMU flag.

  /MMU:   User-mode MMU registers are saved during context switch.

  /NOMMU: They are not saved. The default.

  Some programs map the I/O page and manipulate the user-mode MMU registers
  directly. Without the /MMU fixup any modifications would be lost across
  context switchs.

SET PROGRAM/[NO]LIMIT   

  Sets the program memory limit.

  /LIMIT=n:       Specifies (decimal) program size in kilowords.
  /NOLIMIT        Clears the value. The default depends on the program.

  The /LIMIT fixup is useful for: 

  o FORTRAN programs with virtual arrays use /LIMIT=28    
  o Programs that map the I/O page often use /LIMIT=28    
  o The RT-11 linker, LINK.SAV, requires /LIMIT=28
  o Programs being ported to RSTS or TSX  

SET PROGRAM/[NO]LOOP

  Controls program terminal looping.

  /LOOP:  Permits a program to loop during terminal input.
  /NOLOOP: The program is blocked when no input is available. Default.

  RUST/XM usually blocks a process when it runs out of terminal input
  permitting other processes to run.

  The /LOOP fixup keeps a process scheduled (at priority zero). This helps
  some programs with pathological terminal loops.

SET PROGRAM/[NO]LOWER

  Sets the program lowercase conversion flag.

  /LOWER:         Ignore programs lowercase conversion flag.

  /NOLOWER:       Conversion depends on flag setting.

  Programs specify whether lowercase should be converted to uppercase with a
  flag in the job status word (JSW). This flag is ignored if the LOWER fixup
  is selected. Lowercase is not converted.

SET PROGRAM/[NO]PATHS

  Controls the program's use of directory paths.

  /NOPATHS:       Directory paths are disabled for the program.

  /PATHS:         Directory paths are used. The default.

  Directory paths can be confusing for programs that automatically replace an
  input file (such as editors).

SET PROGRAM/[NO]REALTIME

  Controls a program's realtime behaviour.

  /REALTIME:      The .DEVICE and .[UN]PROTECT are recognised.

  /NOREALTIME:    They are ignored. The default.

  The .DEVICE and .[UN]PROTECT requests can crash the system if not fully
  tested under RUST/XM. The /REALTIME fixup makes sure the system does not
  accept untested programs.

SET PROGRAM/[NO]RT11A

  Normalises RT-11 disks for a program.

  /RT11A:         Normalizes RT-11 disks by supressing disk device codes
                  and VARSZ$ flags.
  /NORT11A        Does not normalise disks. The default.

SET PROGRAM/[NO]RT11S


  /RT11S: Helps programs access remote directories.

  /NORT11S: Provides no help. The default.

  Programs such as KED refuse to work with remote network directories because
  these directories appear internally as magtapes.

  The /RT11S fixup solves this problem by deceiving such programs. It forces
  the system to report such devices as disks. This fixup should only be used
  for programs where the distinction between tapes and disks is not important.

SET PROGRAM/[NO]TRACE

  /NOTRACE: Disables TRACE while the program executes.    
  Ignored if DISPLAY/EVERYTHING is in use.

  /TRACE: TRACE is not disabled. The default.

  This is usually applied to editors and other programs you want to use during
  a debug session.

SET PROGRAM/[NO]TRAPS

  /TRAPS: Process vectors are used for traps.

  /NOTRAPS: They are not used. The default.

  Some programs have their own bus, mmu and cpu trap handlers. Use the /TRAPS
  fixup to pass control to them. You have to disable the process debugger or
  use the debugger T (transfer) command.

SET PROGRAM/[NO]UNMAPPED

  /UNMAPPED: Forces system to report an unmapped environment.

  /MAPPED: A mapped environment is reported. The default.

  Some programs act differently in mapped and unmapped environments.

SET [NO]PROMPT prompt

  SET NOPROMPT provides a null prompt.

  Prompt  
    Upto seven characters. The characters ', ( and ) are not permitted.

SET PROMPT/PROCESS

  Sets the prompt to the process name terminated with >.

SET SL ON|OFF

  Turns the command editor on and off.

  See SET [NO]EDIT.

  This command is provided for compatibility with RT-11.

About RUST/SJ

  The RUST/SJ single-user operating system supports an RT-11 compatible
  operating system environment on most PDP-11 emulators and machines.

  This is the beta release of the system. A multi-user version, RUST/XM,
  is in preparation.

  RUST/SJ documentation is provided by this HELP facility.

Configuration

  RUST configuration overview.

  This set of topics provides quick access to information concerning
  the installation, configuration and general operational behaviour
  of RUST/SJ and RUST/XM.

  The BOOTSTRAP topic details bootstrap procedures.

Bootstrap Procedure

  The bootstrap process.

  Preparation:
  1. The bootstrap files are copied to the device.
  2. The bootstrap files are configured.

  Operation:
  1. The host system loads the device bootstrap.
  2. The device bootstrap loads the BOOT.SYS secondary boot.
  3. BOOT.SYS loads the system image, RUST.SAV or RUSTX.SAV.
  4. RUSTx.SAV reads RUSTx.INI, the initialisation file.
  5. RUSTx.SAV configures the system.
  6. RUSTx.SAV starts the monitor.
  7. The monitor executes RUSTx.COM.

  RUST Clock Support

  o Automatic 50hz/60hz rate detection during bootstrap.
  o Emulator clock rates are hardwired:
    50hz  V11
    60hz  E11, SIMH
  o Automatic detection may be overriden in RUSTx.INI.
  o The TK: driver may be used to substitute for a missing clock.

  RUST/SJ
  o Supports LSI-11, standard and programmable clocks.
    BETA: Programmable clock support requires testing.

  RUST/XM
  o Requires a standard line frequency clock or TK:.

RUST Disk Support

  RUST disk-like device drivers:

  BETA: Many drivers not fully tested under emulators other than V11.

  DD:     TU58 cassette
  DL:     RL01/RL02 disk
  DU:     MSCP disks and diskettes
  DY:     RX01/RX02 diskette
  HD:     Emulator hypothetical disk
  LD:     Logical disk 
  NF:     Disk-like network access
  RK:     RK05 disk
  VM:     Virtual memory disk

  o Some earlier disk drivers were placed in the DECUS library by DEC.
  o Use HELP DRIVERS for more information.

RUST Drivers


  o Use HELP DRIVERS to list the available device drivers.
  o Support is provided for RT-11 V5.5 driver features.
  o RUST native drivers are not backwards compatible with RT-11.

  RUST/SJ
  o RUST/SJ supports no driver SYSGEN options.

  RUST/XM
  o RUST/XM supports any mix of RT-11 SYSGEN options. 
  o Unmapped drivers are supported using buffered I/O.
  o 18-bit driver access to 22-bit memory is also buffered.

RUST Emulator Support

  RUST has been tested on three emulators:

  E11     The high-performance Dbit emulator (www.dbit.com).
  SIMH    The standard Supnik emulator (www.simh.trailing-edge.com).
  V11     The emulator tool supplied with the beta RUST kit.

  BETA: E11 and SIMH driver testing has been limited. Some may fail.

  o RUST detects and reports known emulators during start-up.
  o V11 was implemented as a development tool for RUST. It is supplied
    as a configuration tool.
  o Other emulators were not available for testing.

EIS

  EIS hardware, or an EIS emulator, is a system requirement. EIS is
  the PDP-11 Extended Instruction Set which implements integer multiply,
  divide and shifts. It is used by many RUST utilities.

  RUST/SJ
  o The EI: driver emulates EIS on machines lacking EIS hardware.
    If required, the EI: driver is loaded automatically by the startup
    command file SY:RUST.COM.
  o The RUST/SJ monitor, DCL interpreter, VIP and VIR do not use EIS.

  RUST/XM

History

  In the 1980s HAMMONDsoftware, a German company, produced a range of 
  RT-11 compatible operating systems, beginning with a multi-computer 
  SJ environment (SHAREeleven). The final product, SHAREplus, provided
  a rich multi-user environment.

  The RUST project began with an effort to rejuvinate SHAREplus as
  RUST/XM adding sufficient drivers etc. for it to be run stand-alone.
  Along the way it became clear that an SJ environment would also be
  necessary, so some of the earlier SHAREeleven code was reworked as
  a single-user system, RUST/SJ.

  The goals for RUST/SJ and RUST/XM are to provide a self-sufficient
  environment, and, where possible to bring the systems more into line
  with current software practice. A long-term goal is to provide support
  for legacy hardware.
DCL

Command Files

  The '@' operator is used to execute command files.

  .@mycom         ! executes dk:mycom.com

  The '@' operator is recognised only at the start of a line (preceded
  optionally by a dollar sign and/or label). The command below is invalid: 

  .link @mylink

  o See the sub-topics for parameter and conditional support.
  o Command file data is stored at the top of your process space (setting
    a limit on the size of command files). 
  o Use the SET KMON IND command to redirect command files to the IND 
    control file processor. 

Conditionals

  Command file conditionals.

  IF <condition> THEN command
  IF ... GOTO label
  IF ... @...

  IF "'P1'" THEN ...
  GOTO 'P1'


User Commands

  User command language (UCL) facility.

  name == ...
    Stores the command ... under the name specified in dynamic memory.
  name := ...
    Stores the command under the name specified in the user's UCL data file.
  name ::== ...
    Accepts a command in standard RT-11 UCL syntax and converts it to RUST.


  .hucl := help dcl users ! define the command HUCL

  .hucl :=                ! command deleted if command string blank

  .show commands          ! display all commands
  .show commands h*       ! display all commands beginning with 'H'

UCL Command Names

  Names may contain letters, digits, underline and dollar sign. They 
  must start with a letter. Command name length is not fixed.

  The asterix may be used to mark off a minimum abbreviation.

  dec*imate := ...        ! minimum abbreviation is "dec"

UCL Commands

  UCL command definitions may specify multiple commands. Use 
  the vertical line (|) to separate commands:

  dp := dir x.x|print x.x     ! directory of x.x and then print

  Use ^| to represent a literal '|'.

UCL Parameters

  RUST UCL supports up to nine parameters, ^1 through ^9.

  .dp := dir ^1|print ^1  ! directory of ^1 and then print
  .dp x.x                 ! directory and print x.x

  Use "^" alone to specifically copy the command line.

  Defaults may be specified:

  .dx := dir ^1[a.a]      ! directory of ^1 or a.a if ^1 missing
  .dx x.x                 ! directory of x.x
  .dx                     ! directory of a.a

  Use ^^ to represent a literal '^'.

DU: Partitions

  Booting from DU: partitions. The best way to manage the process 
  is to choose one DU: unit as the the master unit on which you 
  perform all SET operations. DU0: is used in the examples. To 
  configure DU3: as a bootable partition:

  1. SET DU3: UNIT=0, PART=1              ! configure driver
  2. COPY/BOOT DU0:BOOT DU0:              !
  3. BOOT DU0:                            ! if DU: is system device
     REMOVE DU: | LOAD DU:                ! if DU: not the system device
  4. INIT DU3: etc                        ! if DU3: is uninitialized
  5. COPY DUV.SYS DU3:                    ! DU3: must have same driver
  6. COPY/BOOT DU3:BOOT DU3:              ! optional step

  You need to repeat steps 5. and 6. for each bootable DU: unit.

    Additional or alternate hardware drivers.

  Software
    Drivers which perform software functions such tracing program
    requests. Software drivers are usually controlled with:

    .load dd:     ! load and enable driver
    .unload dd:   ! disable and unload
    .remove dd:   ! same as unload, but removes driver as well

AL: Alias Driver

  AL: is used to view the information passed to a driver.

  .load du        ! if DU: isn't already loaded
  .alias duv      ! explicit driver name required
  .load al        ! load the alias driver

  ....
  [ctrl-p]        ! Disable pause operation
  ....
  [ctrl-p]        ! Enable pause operation again

CT: [ctrl-t] Driver

  CT: displays system status in response to [ctrl-t].

  You change the trigger key code with SET CT KEY=octal. For example, 
  SET CT KEY=1 sets the trigger to [ctrl-a]. Reload the driver.

  SET CT: KEY=octal       ! redefine the control key

  o The device name conflicts with the cassette driver.

Overview

  DB: provides an alternate approach to ODT. The debugger displays
  symbolic instructions and provides a fairly rich set of step, watch
  and recording facilities.

  o You can flip between symbolic and numeric displays.
  o You can step through or over instructions.
  o Watch lets you traps modifications to specific location.
  o Recording lets you backtrack through code.
  o You can inhibit debugger traps and pass traps to applications.

  o A single breakpoint is supported.
  o Operations are word-oriented.

  o BG: provides an alternative smaller debugger.

Command Syntax

  DB: command syntax.

  An (octal) number, by itself or preceding a command, sets the
  display location.

  1000    ...     | 2000g
  2000    ...     |

  Commands consist of one or two characters, followed, in some 
  cases by a number:

  1000            | ps            ! display psw
  PS      000001  | =2            ! deposit 2

  Commands may be strung together except where ambiguity arises.

  1000    ...     | @sp=1000p     ! three commands
  1000    ...     | rp            ! is RP command, not R then P

Display

  Display commands

  /       Flip instruction/data mode.
  \       Flip octal/decimal mode.
  In instruction mode the debugger displays PDP-11 instructions.
  In data mode the debugger displays word/bytes, rad50 and ascii
  data. You can flip between octal and decimal. 

  Address Value   Instruction                     
  ------- -----   -----------
  003312  004367  jsr     r3,11274                Instruction

  003316  15703   61 87   i2w [W=]                Data - Decimal

  003312  004367  jsr     r3,11274         |
  003316  036527  bit     20461(r5),#77053 | \    ! Flip to data
  003316  036527  075 127 i2w [W=]         | /    ! Flip to decimal

Memory 

  Examining and modifying memory.

  n       Open location n 
  +[n]    Open .+n, default is 2
  -[n]    Open .-n, default is 2
  @       Open indirect   
  _       Open relative
  %       Open branch
  D       Open destination
  .       Open PC location

Registers

  Examining and modifying registers.

  PC      Display PC
  PS      Display PSW
  R0:R7   Display register
  SP      Display SP

  The example below opens R5, modifies it and then uses [enter]
  to examine the other registers.

  132072  000261  sec                      | r5
  R5      131610  263 210 ./  [..]         | =400[enter]
  R6      001702  003 302  xb [..]         | [enter]
  R7      132072  264 072 .3r [:.]         | [enter]
  PS      000004  000 004   d [..]         | [enter]
  R0      000000  000 000     [..]         | [enter]

Execution

  Execution commands.

  P       Proceed 
  Proceed gives control back to a program until a breakpoint is 
  encountered or until you use [ctrl-h] to interrupt the program.
  Instructions are recorded if recording is enabled.

  TT      Transfer trap
  In some cases the debugger will intercept a trap that was expected
  by a program. You can transfer trap to the program with TT.

  X       Exit program
  The exit command causes the program executing to exit.

Step

  The step commands let you single-step a program.

  S       Step
  I       Step Into
  O       Step Over
  In the example the step command steps "over" the CALL instruction
  at 132074. Use the I command to step "into" a sub-routine.

  132072  000261  sec                      | s
  132074  004737  call    @#146636         | s
  132100  103006  bcc     132116           | s

  H       Step Here
  Use the Step Here command to specify where a program should be
  intercepted. In the example the command causes instructions from
  132074 up to 132102 to be executed.

  132074  004737  call    @#146636         | [enter]
  132100  103006  bcc     132116           | [enter]
  132102  032737  bit     #100,@#44        | h
  132102  032737  bit     #100,@#44        | 

Break Commands

  Break commands.

  B       Set break at location
  CB      Clear break
  DB: supports a single explicit break point. The example sets the
  break at 147312 and then proceeds with execution. Control returns
  to the debugger when the program reaches the breakpoint. The CB
  command clears the breakpoint.

  147306  126726  cmpb    146000,(sp)+     |
  147312  000205  rts     r5               | bp
  ?DB-I-BPT trap 147312
  147312  000205  rts     r5               | cb

  RB      Remove break
  You use this command to remove a manual break from a program. The
  command is shorthand for -2=240.

Watch commands

  Watch commands.

  W       Watch location
  CW      Clear watch
  The Watch command traps changes to the value at a specified
  location. CW disables watch.

  In the example a watch is set on location zero and execution 
  proceeds. Watch detects a change in the value and displays the 
  old and new values. The Last command is used to see which 
  command caused the modification.

  147314  032767  bit     #10000,44        | 0w
  000000  040000  mov     r0,0(sp)         | p
  ?DB-I-Watch 000000: Old=040000 New=010067
  146250  001413  beq     146300           | l
  146246  005210  inc     (r0)             |

  Watch checks a location for changes each time the debugger is
  entered, or, after every instruction if recording is enabled.

Recording Instructions

  DB: supports a 64-word instruction recording buffer. With recording 
  enabled, instructions are entered into the ring-buffer. Execution
  takes about forty times longer.

  ER DR   Enable/Disable recording.
  Enable recording of application instructions. Default is disable.

  EP DP   Enable/Disable pervasive recording.
  Enable recording of application and system instructions. Default
  is disable.

  P       Proceed
  Proceed does the recording when recording is active.

  L       Display previous
  Displays the preceding (last) entry in the recording buffer.

  N       Display next
  Displays the succeeding (next) entry.

Traps

  Debugger entry traps.

  EA  DA  Address traps
  EB  DB  BPT traps
  EI  DI  Instruction traps
  EK  DK  Keyboard traps
  The debugger is initially gains control via BPT, address traps,
  instruction traps and [ctrl-h]. You can disable each of these.

  1000    ...     | DA            ! disable address traps

Stack monitor

  DB: monitors the stack for underflow. The underflow test takes
  place at the start of the bus address trap entry.

  SU[value]
  DB: initially monitors the stack for underflow at location 400.
  You alter this with the SU (Set Underflow) command.

  1000    ...     | SU500         ! catch stack below 500
  1000    ...     | P             ! continue processing
  ?DB-I-STK trap 3404
  3404    ...     | @sp           ! look at real stack
  110112  372     |               ! offending stack
  1000    ...     | SU            ! disable stack monitor

  DB: uses an internal stack to handle underflow traps. The address
  of the stack at the time of the trap is available with @SP.

Bootstrap debugging

  DB: can be used to debug driver bootstraps.

  1. LOAD dev:
  2. COPY/BOOT dev:BOOT dev:
     You need to set a breakpoint in the bootstrap, either in the 
     source or by patching the driver or boot block.
  3. SET DEBUG
  4. SET DB: BOOT=dev:
  5. BOOT/FOREIGN dev:
  6. Bootstrap breakpoint passes control to DB:
     Since the keyboard is blocked CTRL-H is not available.
     DB: loses control when the system overwrites the vector area.
     DB: resides in a memory no-mans-land but usually survives.
  7. Debug your driver.
  8. Use COPY/BOOT to restore the bootstrap block.

  o To get a feel for PM:, load PM: and then run the SNAIL tool.

PM: Display

  PM: histogram display conventions.

  Each line reports activity for 4kw of memory, each cell for 64 words.

  Lines that have no data are omitted. Each cell reports a hexadecimal 
  power-of-two counter. For example, "4" means a count in the range 2^4
  to (2^5)-1, i.e. 16 to 31.  Special values are:

     space      0
  _  underline  1
  .  period     2  2-3
  =  equals     3  3-7
  ^  hat        4  8-15
  @  at-sign    overflow 

PM: Example

  Here's a sample display (truncated to seven columns). The punctuation 
  marks are the low counts. The highest activity, "D" in the 120000 line, 
  is the inner-loop of the SL: driver. "DB|E" is the terminal input
  routine in the monitor.

Driver settings

  Examining driver settings.

  You use the DRIVER utility to display the current SET configuration
  of drivers configured under RUST. You can also SET items:

  .driver
  DRIVER> show mov
  SET MOV AUTO
  SET MOV CSR=176500
  SET MOV RIGHT
  SET MOV VECTOR=300
  DRIVER> set mov csr=160100
  DRIVER> set mov vector=310
  DRIVER> exit

  See the DRIVER utility help entry for more information.

Driver Suffixes

  The driver suffix is the third character of a driver filename.
  For example, the suffix of DDV.SYS is "V". 

  Each suffix is associated with a specific native system:

  Suffix  Example   Native system
  ------  -------   --------------
  none    DD.SYS    RT-11/SJ and RT-11/FB
  X       DDX.SYS   RT-11/XM

  V       DDV.SYS   RUST/SJ
  W       DDW.SYS   RUST/SJ on the V11 emulator
  P       DDP.SYS   RUST/XM

  Additional information describes the way suffixes are used by
  RT-11 and RUST.

RT-11 Driver Suffixes

  RT-11 uses fixed runtime suffixs.

  RT-11 uses only the drivers as defined by the system suffix.

  On RT-11 you can change the system suffix with a SYSGEN operation.
  For example, you could SYSGEN an RT-11/FB system with the suffix "F".
  All drivers for that sysgened system would then have suffix "F".

  Since the suffix is fixed it need not be specified. The one exception
  for RT-11 is the COPY/BOOT command which accepts an optional driver 
  specification with suffix:

  .copy/boot:dlv boot dl1:        ! use driver DL1:DLV.SYS        

RUST Driver Suffixes

  RUST uses search paths to find the best available driver.

  System          Search Path
  -------         -----------
  RUST/SJ         ddW.sys ddV.SYS dd.SYS
  RUST/XM         ddP.SYS ddX.SYS ddV.SYS dd.SYS

  Thus, for DU:, RUST/SJ searchs first DUW.SYS if its running under V11,
  then DUV.SYS and then DU.SYS. You can use INSTALL/LOG or LOAD/LOG to 
  see which driver RUST selects.

  In general, the search path operation is transparent. Regular RT-11 
  commands function in the expected manner. 

  Further information lists commands where a suffix is implicit, explicit
  or optional.

Suffix-related commands

  Commands which treat the suffix as implicit:

  .set [device] dd:       Device name with required colon (:).
  .show device dd:                
  .unload dd:
  .remove dd:

  Commands which require an explicit suffix:

  .analyse driver duv
  .set driver duv ...
  .show driver duv

  Commands which accept an optional suffix:

  .install nfw
  .load nfw
  .copy/boot:nfw ...      
KEYPAD

  KEYPAD text editor and word processor.

  BETA: See LIMITATIONS.
  BETA: Keypad is currently a page-oriented editor.
  BETA: Word processing and HTML features are incomplete and buggy.

  KEYPAD, the native RUST editor, combines KED/EDT and Notepad/Wordpad
  features. The right-hand keypad follows KED/EDT conventions.

  KEYPAD can be used as a typical PDP-11 text editor or as a limited
  word processor. Word processor documents are stored in HTML format.

KEYPAD Character Set

  KEYPAD eight-bit character set.

  KEYPAD recognises the DEC multi-national character set (DEC-MCS).
  KEYPAD case conversion operations handle eight-bit characters.

  The HTML character set ISO-8859-1 was derived from DEC-MCS. KEYPAD
  recognises the relevant character set entities during HTML input
  (e.g "&Uuml;"). HTML entity output is in hex (e.g. "&#37;").

  To work with eight-bit characters you need to ensure that the
  terminal is enabled for eight-bit operation (the default setting).
  See SET TT EIGHT_BIT.

Limitations

  KEYPAD beta limitations.

  o KEYPAD is currently a page-oriented editor. That is, you work on 
    one page at a time. A crude mechanism has been implemented to allow
    you to walk and search back through a file however it is punishingly
    slow on larger files (and lacks a "WORKING..." message).

  o Word processing functionality is preliminary. Font changes of the
    select area along with font correction during cut and paste are
    not done.

  o KEYPAD recognises HTML files during input and automatically converts
    output of such to HTML. Newly created HTML files need to be converted
    manualy (with Gold-H) a page at a time.

  o KEYPAD doesn't produce a backup file.

Word Processing

  KEYPAD provides a minimal set of word processing facilities.

  o Automatic line-wrapping
  o Indents (Gold-E and Gold-D),
  o Bullets (Gold-B)
  o Horizontal lines (Gold-R)
  o Bold font (Ctrl-B)

  BETA: The only reliable way to use Ctrl-B (Bold) is to insert text
  immediately after typing Ctrl-B.

KEYPAD HTML Subset

  KEYPAD supports an HTML subset.

  BETA: HTML only works with single-page files.

  KEYPAD automatically recognises and converts HTML input files
  KEYPAD discards all unrecognised HTML objects (and that means most
  of them). 

  You can view, and edit, the HTML rendition with Gold-H. Return
  to the formatted rendition with Gold-F. 

  In the beta you have to manually convert formatted text for HTML
  storage (with Gold-H).
NF RUST Network

  NF (Network Files) is RUST's Ethernet networking package.

  RUST clients access files in native server directories as if they 
  were local files in RT-11 directories, using standard commands, 
  applications and program requests. Server directories are made 
  available via logical names. NF servers provide time-of-day 
  information. RUST/SJ can be booted from the Windows server.

  ------          ------  ------  -----
  RUST/SJ         Yes     No      DEQNA/DELQA only. Complete in 1.2kw.

About NF

  General NF characteristics.

  NF is a peer-to-peer file access vehicle, much like Microsoft NETBUI.
  Once installed, NF operation is largely transparent to the user,
  although one or two utilities do complain. RUST/XM provides workarounds
  for these programs.

  NF is designed to emulate RT-11 file system behaviour when accessing
  remote disks. On a Q-bus RUST/SJ system the complete package requires
  only 1500 words. Because of these two attributes NF cannot even dream
  about compatibility with any existing network standard.

  NF is primarily a remote disk access vehicle. In earlier implementations
  it has supported remote terminal access, but this code is currently
  waiting for rejuvination.

NF Compatibility

  NF File system compatibility

  Each operating system has its own file system behaviour. For example,
  under RT-11 a new file first appears in a directory after the file is
  closed. Under Windows a new file appears in a directory when it is 
  created. Under VMS new files are given version numbers.

  Many RT-11 applications rely implicitly on RT-11 file system behaviour.
  NF goes to extraordinary lengths to map RT-11 behaviour to the native
  file system. To achieve this goal NF creates intermediate files with 
  .TEN or .REN filetypes. These files are usually renamed or deleted but
  may be left hanging after system aborts.

  Server directories appear to the RT-11 client as read-only RT-11 
  directories. Only files that fit the RT-11 6.3 naming convention and
  are less than 65536 blocks long are visible. The first six blocks of
  a directory may be written and read as if they were an RT-11 device.
  The file VOLUME.SYS is created on the fly to hold this data.

NF Limitations

  Operations not supported by NF. RUST clients can't access:

  o Filenames outside the RT-11 6.3 convention
  o Logical names longer than three characters
  o Files of 65536 blocks or more
  o Files past the directory 31-segment mark

  BETA restrictions:

  CREATE  Files are always zero blocks at present.
  INIT    Doesn't delete files.
  MD/RD   RUST clients can't create or delete directories.

NF Protection

  NF Server-side device, directory and file protection.

  Clients only have access to devices and directories made available
  with explicit logical name definitions at the server.

  Once a device or directory is made available, it, and all its
  subdirectories and files become available to all nodes according
  to the access rights of the server process.

  See Limitations for other access restrictions.

NF Bootstrap

  NF Bootstrap operation.

  o The Windows NF server supports MOP bootstrap protocol subset.
    ROM QNA bootstrap and standard RT-11 BOOT command supported.
  o All boots take place using NF7:. VUP remaps NF0: to NF7: for boots.
  o The server logical name NF7: is used to locate the boot directory.
    The Windows server defaults the location of NF7: to "RUST:\DEV\NF7".
    The boot directory is a native Windows directory, not an RT-11 volume.
  o The server logical names RT_SY and RT_DK are used to locate SY: and DK:
    The Windows server defaults RT_SY and RT_DK to "NF7".
  o The boot directory must be preconfigured with a RUST system and boot.
    Use the standard INIT, COPY/BOOT etc commands under V11 to preconfigure.
    The distribution kit includes a minimal preconfigured boot directory.
  o RUST bootstrap clients all boot from the same boot directory, NF7:.
    It's up to you to synchronise boot directory activities.
    You can reassign DK: and SY: after the boot completes.

NF Bootstrap internals

  NF Bootstrap internals notes.

  o The full MOP protocol is quite extensive. NF implements only the
    essentials: the online message and the MOP bootstrap request.

  o A ROM boot downloads a bootstrap to a buffer at location 1000.
    RUST places a copy routine at 1000 and the 256-word boot at 2000.
    The 256-word boot is taken from block zero of VF7:

  o The actual boot is crammed into 256 words so that can also be
    used as a standard RT-11 driver bootstrap.

  o The bootstrap has a simple instruction-counting timeout loop.
    Thus you can start the NF server after you've triggered the boot.
    The timeout periods are quite long.

NF: Installation

  .load nf

  PDP-11 RUST/XM:

  1. Start the client ACP (NFW.SAV) as below.
  2. Load the RUST/XM NF: driver (NFP.SYS)

  .create/process/nolog nfs/image=sy:nfw/work=20
  .wait ::1

  V11 RUST/XM:



V11 Installation

  Installing NF on V11.

  The V11 PDP-11 emulator has embedded NF client/server software.
  The paths taken by RUST/SJ and RUST/XM are:  

            Device/Driver    Client        Server
            -------------    ------        ------
  RUST/SJ:  NF: (NFW.SYS) -> V11 client -> V11 server
  RUST/XM:  NF: (NFP.SYS) -> NFW.SAV    -> V11 server

  RUST/SJ installation:

  .load nfw               ! load nf: windows driver

  RUST/XM installation:

  .create/process nfw/image=sy:nfw/work=20
  .wait ::1               ! wait for process to settle
  .load nf                ! install front-end driver

Windows Installation

  Installing NF: on Windows.

  You must install (free) Ethernet interfacing package Winpcap from
  http://www.winpcap.org (about 450kb). Installation is painless.
  The current RUST release has been tested with WinPcap V3.0.

  After WinPcap is installed you simply run the Windows server:

  .nf

  o See WINDOWS NF for command switch information.

NF Logical names

  Defining NF logical names.

  The path to a server directory is established with two logical names.
  On the client you assign the logical name to NF:

  .define tmp nf:         ! pass TMP: accesses to server

  On the server you define a matching logical name that specifies the
  actual directory or device:

  .define tmp c:\tmp      ! define the server path for TMP:

  o On Windows servers you use the SHE shell to create logical names.
  o On RUST/XM and VMS servers you use the DCL DEFINE command.

NF Overloaded names

  Overloaded logical names.

  Conflict may arise between a native server and client logical names.
  For example, "LIB" might be used at the server to access the native 
  library but at a client to access RT-11 library files.

  NF servers provide a solution by first translating logical names
  with an "RT_" prefix. Thus, a server first looks for "RT_LIB" and
  then "LIB". You can use this behaviour to explicitly deny access.

  $ define rt_lib c:\pdp\lib      ! define separate client logical
  $ define rt_tmp error           ! deny access to server TMP:

Catch-All Redirection

  NF logical name catch-all redirection.

  The command below redirects most undefined logical names to NF:

  .define * nf:

  Redirection applies only to names with three alphabetic characters:
  patterns below are not mapped (where X is any alpha and 0 any digit):

          X       XX
          X2      XX1
          X23

  Catch-all redirection is particularly useful for RUST/SJ systems 
  with their limited storage capacity for logical names.

BOOT            

  RUST bootstrap manager.

  BOOT.SYS is a dual-purpose utility: You run it as an application
  to configure the bootstrap environment (see Commands).

  .r boot.sys             ! run boot interactively
  .set image rust         ! select the system image
  .exit                   ! er, exit

  BOOT's second function is to act as a proxy RT-11 bootstrap. See
  Operation and Monitor.

  .copy/boot boot dev:    ! copy boot to device
  .boot dev:              ! boot boot.sys

  o This utility has its own HELP facility.

BOOT Operation

  The RUST bootstrap takes place in a number of stages.

  1. BOOT.SYS is bootstrapped using the usual RT-11 bootsrap procedure.
     BOOT.SYS is a tiny RT-11 operating system entirely contained in the
     four-block RT-11 bootsrap disk area (blocks 2 to 5).

  2. BOOT.SYS activates the program specified by the SET IMAGE command.
     This is usually RUST/SJ or RUST/XM but can be any program that
     confines its activities to the EMTs etc provided by BOOT.SYS.

  3. RUST/SJ begins by determining its environment and then loading the
     essential devices (TT:, SY: and clock). This process is controlled
     by the [BOOTSTRAP] section of RUST.INI.

  4. The RUST/SJ monitor is relocated to high memory and activated. It's
     first task is to execute the command file SY:RUST.COM which takes
     care of loading additional devices etc.

BOOT Monitor

  BOOT.SYS provides a subset RT-11 operating system environment. See
  Programming for a list of software facilities. BOOT prompts for a
  command when started with the NOIMAGE option, or when a program exits.
  You respond with the name of a program:

  BOOT> cpu               ! run CPU.SAV, a test program

  BOOT supports these control keys:

  Control Key     Purpose
  -----------     -------
  CTRL-C          Interrupt program
  CTRL-H          Halt computer
  CTRL-Q          Restart output
  CTRL-R          Pass control to ROM boot (173000)
  CTRL-S          Suspend output

BOOT Programming

  Programming facilities available from BOOT.

  o Standard RT-11 programs may be loaded. Overlays are supported.
  o The standard RMON database is present and the clock functions.
  o SY: supports .DSTATU, .CSTAT, .LOOKUP, .READ and .CLOSE.
  o The terminal supports .TTYIN, .TTYOUT, .GTLIN and .PRINT.
  o .DATE, .EXIT, .GJOB, .GVAL, .GTIM, .PEEK, .SETTOP are supported.
  o .DELETE, .ENTER, .RENAME, .SAVEST, .REOPEN, .WRITE, .SPFUN are invalid.
  o The remaining program requests are ignored (R0 unchanged, C=0).

  SY: is the only supported device. BOOT.SYS uses the bootstrap driver,
  usually located in block zero of a device, to access the system disk.
  The driver is swapped out of low memory when a program is running and
  swapped back to handle I/O operations.

  This small subset of RT-11 is sufficient for RUST/SJ and RUST/XM
  to get started and for test programs which use BOOT as a maintenance
  monitor.

BUILD           

  Extracts command files from source and creates text files.

  o Extracts embedded command files from source files.
  o Creates text files from command files.
  o Updates date, time and edit information in source files.
  o Updates a database with module change information.
  o Creates a command file to backup changed modules.

CALC [expression]

  A simple calculator.

  Expression      Operation
  ----------      --------
  0..9            Signed 32-bit integers
  + - / *         Binary operations. The usual priorities apply
  + -             Unary operations.
  ++ --           Prefix increment and decrement.
  ( )             Parentheses
  C               Clear entry
  D               Displays the expression parse tree (e.g. "d12*3").
  E or X          Exit

  o CALC implements the DISPLAY expression command.

CALC Examples

  Single-line and interactive mode.

  .calc 2*2       ! Single-line command operation
  4

  .r calc         ! Interactive mode
  CALC> 4*40      ! Start calculation - result is next prompt
  160> -30        ! Continue expression: equivalent to "160-30"           
  130> 567*567    ! Accumulator is cleared for new operation
  321489>

  Continued expressions interpret a leading "-" as subtract, not negate.
  Use the Clear (C) to start a new expression with a negative number.

  CALC> 4*40      ! Start calculation - result is next prompt
  160> c-30*3     ! Don't continue. New expression.
  -90>

CLOCK

  Sets the system time using NF: or DD: to access a server.

  .clock          ! set system time

  o CLOCK is usually inserted in the RUST startup command file.

CONSOL

  Alters the system terminal CSR and vector addresses.

  Switch          Operation
  -------         --------
  /C:n            Specifies the CSR address
  /L              Lists the current settings.
  /S              Saves the settings.;i
  /V:n            Specifies the vector address.

  .console                     ! switch using saved values
  .console /c:177600/v:310     ! explicit switch 
  .console /c:177600/v:310/s   ! save (don't switch)
  .console /l                  ! list (don't switch)
  ?CONSOL-I-CSR=177600 Vector=310    

  o Operation under RUST/XM is quite different.
  o Replaces the standard RT-11 CONSOL.SAV.

DATIME

  Prompts for the date and time.

  .datime
  Date [dd-mmm-yyyy]? 2 march 2005
  Time [hh:mm:ss]? 9:54
  Startup File [filnam.typ]?

  o Accepts RUST DCL date/time syntax.
  o Replaces the standard RT-11 DATIME utility.

DCL             

  The RUST DCL command interpreters.

  Image           System
  -----           ------
  DCL.SAV         RUST/SJ
  DCL.SYS         RUST/XM

  o "R DCL" will hang RUST/SJ. Abort with double CTRL-C.

ZIP Logical Disks

  Zipping multiple files as logical disks.

  The standard form of distribution for RT-11 is to package files into
  logical disks. This is also the best way to handle multiple files with
  ZIP and UNZIP. Here's the basic procedure:

  .md \dist\/allocate=200 ! create logical disk as sub-directory
  .erase \dist\           ! clear it to optimise compression
  .init \dist\            ! reinitialize logical disk
  .copy prj:*.* \dist\*.* ! copy files to the directory
  .zip dist.dsk dist.z    ! zip it
  .rd \dist\              ! clean up

  o The sub-directory must be created on RT-11 media.
  o Another way to optimise is to compute the minimum logical disk size.
RUST Windows Environment

  o C:\RUST\ directory tree
  o SHE command shell
  o V11 PDP-11 emulator

  o DD: network server
  o NF: network server

Windows DD: Server

  The Windows TU58 DD: server.

  .DD/switches [device]

  Device
    The name of the comm device, typically COM1 through COM4.
    DD attachs the first available comm port if none is specified.

  /4800     Connects at 4800 baud instead of 9600 baud.
  /19200    Connects at 19200 baud instead of 9600 baud.
  /BOOT     Downloads a bootstrap (see BOOT subtopic)
  /DETACH   Creates a new process and console to run DD.EXE
  /ECHO     Echo characters received (loopback test)
  /HELP     Display command and switch summary
  /HIDE     Creates a new process without a console to run DD.EXE
  /LDA      Downloads a bootstrap in PDP-11 absolute loader format
  /LIST     List available comm ports
  /LOG      Reports significant events
  /VERBOSE  Reports internal operations

DD Bootstrap

  Booting DD:.

  The regular PDP-11 ROM DD bootstraps and RT-11 BOOT commands may 
  be used to boot a system from DD0:. If neither of these options is
  available then you may use one of the two cooperative boots below.

  LDA Bootstrap
    1. Execute the LSI-11 microODT command nnnnnnH where nnnnnn is 
       the address of the serial line CSR, typically 176500.
    2. Initiate the Windows DD server with the /LDA switch.

  Toggle-in Bootstrap
    1. Initiate the Windows DD server with the /BOOT switch.
    2. Toggle in the DD: bootstrap (see sub-topic).
    3. Disable the PDP-11 clock during the bootstrap.
    4. Start the bootstrap at location 10000

DD: Toggle-in Bootstrap

  The PDP-11 DD: toggle-in bootstrap.

  Address Value
  ------- -----
  10000   011706
     02   012700
     04   001000
     16   005001
  10010   105737
     12   176500
     14   100375
     16   113721
  10020   176502
     22   005300
     24   001371
  10026   000110

DD: Disks

  Configuring DD: disks.

  The DD server locates disk container files with the logical names DD0: 
  through DD6:. The following commands define DD0: and DD2:.

  .define dd0 pdp:dd.dsk
  .define dd2 pdp:mydisk.dsk

  You can define new DD units and redefine DD units at any time, in just
  the same way that you can change physical media at will. It is up to you
  to ensure that connected PDP-11s will not be affected. The system provides
  no protection.

  DD7: is used for internal purposes (such as supplying the client with the
  date and time).

DD PDP-11 Setup

  Configuring the PDP-11 serial line connection.

  Before you use the DD server you need to connect one of the Comm
  ports on the windows machine to a serial line connecter on the 
  target PDP-11.

  You need a so-called data cable, i.e. one in which the send and
  receive lines are cross-connected. The PDP-11 end will typically
  be wired as a null modem.

NF: Server

  NF.EXE is the RUST Windows ethernet network server. 

  .NF/switches [device]

  Device
    The name of the ethernet (ndis) device. If no device is specified
    NF attachs the first available ethernet device.

  /DETACH     Creates a new process and console to run NF.EXE
  /HALT       Halt client before bootstrap starts
  /HELP       Display command and switch summary
  /HIDE       Creates a new process without a console to run NF.EXE
  /INFO       Display information and warning messages
  /LI[ST]     Lists the available network devices.
  /LOG        Reports significant events
  /NOMOP      Disables MOP BOOT operations
  /VERBOSE    Reports internal operations

  o See NETWORKS for more information.

Windows command shell

  SHE.EXE, the RUST Windows command shell.

  SHE provides a working environment that supports DEC-style logical
  names. Logical names (of up to three characters) are available to 
  the emulator and networked RUST systems.

  SHE hosts the V11 PDP-11 emulator and may be used to initiate
  the DD: and NF: servers.

  The command prompt is "o". You can change it with SET PROMPT. The
  dollar sign "$" is used as the prompt in examples. Comments begin
  with the exclamation mark "!".

Logical Names

  Shell logical name environment.

  ROOT            is translated via the registry
                  still needs definition though
  C:              single letter device names are not translated

  Logical names are permanent, stored in RUST:ROLL.DEF.

  The registry key WIN_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\RUST stores the 
  shell root directory under \Root. The root is shared by all 
  shell utilities. 

  Name            Operation
