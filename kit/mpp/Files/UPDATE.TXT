   INTRODUCTION1  INTRODUCTION

This  document   describes   the   significant   differences   between
MicroPower/Pascal  Version  2.2  and the MicroPower/Pascal Version 2.3
update release.  Section 2  describes  new  features,  and  Section  3
describes   software  fixes.   Unless  otherwise  indicated,  the  new
features and the bug fixes made between Version 2.2  and  Version  2.3
are common to all host implementations of the product.



   NEW FEATURES FOR VERSION 2.32  NEW FEATURES FOR VERSION 2.3

     MicroPDP-11/532.1  MicroPDP-11/53

The MicroPDP-11/53 is a J11-based processor with 512  KB  of  on-board
RAM.   It  is  supported  as a host development system and as a target
system.  As a target, however, it is supported as a RAM-only system.



     KXJ11-CA Capabilities2.2  KXJ11-CA Capabilities

The KXJ11-CA

      o  Supports both mapped and unmapped applications

      o  Is a J11-based processor

      o  Has  a  floating-point  instruction  set  included   in   the
         microcode

      o  Contains 512 KB of on-board RAM

      o  Has RAM that can be configured as shared memory, which can be
         accessed  by  devices on the Q-Bus as well as by the on-board
         processor



     QD Driver2.3  QD Driver

The request packet format and the  Pascal  driver  interface  routines
have  changed  so  that  they  can  work  in  both mapped and unmapped
environments.  See chapter 9 of the I/O Services Manual as well as the
QDINC.PAS and DMA.PAS files.



     Incompatibility - QD Driver and Interface Routines2.4  Incompatibility - QD Driver and Interface Routines

A new field, ADRTYP, has been added to the record type DMA$ADDRESS  to
support  the  mapped  version  of  the  driver  running on a KXJ11-CA.
Pascal programs that use the  Pascal  interface  routines  to  the  QD
driver  may  have  to  be modified to include this field.  See Section
9.3.1 of the I/O Services Manual for an explanation of the use of this
field.
                                                                Page 2


In addition, the  request  packet  interface  to  the  QD  driver  has
changed.  Programs that send request packets directly to the QD driver
may have to be modified.  See Section 9.4 of the I/O  Services  Manual
for an explanation of the new request packet interface.



   SOFTWARE FIXES3  SOFTWARE FIXES

     Compiler -- VMS Only, Command Line Error3.1  Compiler -- VMS Only, Command Line Error

The MP/P-VMS compiler generated  a  diagnostic  message  for  a  valid
command  line  that contained multiple values on the /CHECK qualifier.
For example,

     MPPASCAL/CHECK=(MATH,POINTER,STACK) A



     Compiler -- LONGINTEGERs with /FPP3.2  Compiler -- LONGINTEGERs with /FPP

Incorrect  code  was  generated  to  write  an  expression   involving
LONGINTEGERs.   The  incorrect code was generated only if /INS=FPP was
used and the expression existed only once in the procedure.



     Compiler -- Records of Two 8-bit Values3.3  Compiler -- Records of Two 8-bit Values

Incorrect code was generated when a 16-bit record variable, made up of
two  8-bit values, was moved from the stack to memory and subsequently
used in an IF statement.  Incorrect code was generated only if  /DEBUG
was not used.



     Compiler -- UNSAFE RECORD of Two 0 To 255s3.4  Compiler -- UNSAFE RECORD of Two 0 To 255s

Incorrect code was generated when an INTEGER was assigned to a RECORD,
made  up  of  two  values  in  the  range 0 to 255, and had the UNSAFE
attribute.



     Compiler -- Arrays Larger Than 8192 Bytes3.5  Compiler -- Arrays Larger Than 8192 Bytes

If the parameter of the address function was an array whose  size  was
greater   than   8192  bytes,  the  compiler  reported  error  189  --
"Declarations may not exceed 65536 bytes/bits ...." This  error  would
also  be generated if certain file operations were used on a file that
had a basetype of a size greater than 8192 bytes.
                                                                Page 3


     Compiler -- Illegal Set Element Aborts Compiler3.6  Compiler -- Illegal Set Element Aborts Compiler

If an illegal element was  used  in  a  set  constructor,  compilation
aborted with an "Array Index Out of Range" error message.



     Compiler -- Out-of-Bound Set Value Aborts3.7  Compiler -- Out-of-Bound Set Value Aborts

When a set constructor was used with an  out-of-bound  integer  value,
the  compiler aborted with an "Odd Address or Other Trap" error rather
than issue a "Value Out of Range" diagnostic.



     Compiler -- Missing Parameter with /FILTER Switch3.8  Compiler -- Missing Parameter with /FILTER Switch

If default parameters were invoked in  a  procedure/function  call  by
their  not  being  specified,  and  the  /FILTER  switch was used, the
compiler issues an erroneous "Bad Operand" diagnostic  in  the  scnopt
phase.



     Compiler -- Empty REPEAT in a WITH3.9  Compiler -- Empty REPEAT in a WITH

If a REPEAT statement had an empty statement block, and it was in  the
scope of a WITH, and the UNTIL expression involved a record field that
made use of the  WITH,  compilation  aborted  with  a  "System  Access
Violation" error.



      Compiler -- Missing Unspecified Procedure Parameter3.10  Compiler -- Missing Unspecified Procedure Parameter

If a procedure/function parameter was not  specified,  or  its  formal
parameter  name  was  misspelled,  compilation  aborted with a "System
Access Violation" error.



      Compiler -- Terminate Procedure with /FILTER3.11  Compiler -- Terminate Procedure with /FILTER

If a program contained procedures having the terminate attribute,  and
they  were  never  referenced, the compilation of the program with the
/FILTER switch caused all such  procedures  to  be  removed  from  the
program and thus never executed.



      Compiler -- Undiagnosed IN Operand Out-of-Bounds3.12  Compiler -- Undiagnosed IN Operand Out-of-Bounds

In the expression (elt IN set), if set was an integer subrange and elt
was  out-of-bounds  (less  than 0 or greater than 255), this error was
not diagnosed.
                                                                Page 4


      Compiler -- Undiagnosed LONGINTEGER in a FOR Loop3.13  Compiler -- Undiagnosed LONGINTEGER in a FOR Loop

The illegal use of a LONGINTEGER control variable in a  FOR  loop  was
not diagnosed.



      Compiler -- Undefined Procedure with Missing Parameter3.14  Compiler -- Undefined Procedure with Missing Parameter

If an  undefined  procedure/function  was  called  with  one  or  more
parameters  unspecified,  compilation  aborted  with  a "System Access
Violation" error.



      Compiler -- Size Function with Illegal Parameter3.15  Compiler -- Size Function with Illegal Parameter

If an illegal but defined identifier was  used  in  any  of  the  size
functions;  that  is,  size,  next,  bitsize, and bitnext, compilation
aborts with a "System Access Violation" error.



      Compiler -- WRITE of Mixed-Mode Expressions3.16  Compiler -- WRITE of Mixed-Mode Expressions

                                                            RIf a procedure contains an expression of the form  Integer  Real  from
within  a  WRITE  statement, and if the Integer is a parameter and the
Real a local variable, incorrect results occur.

Incorrect code was generated for the program below.


PROGRAM QAR211 (INPUT, OUTPUT);

  PROCEDURE Nogood (I : INTEGER);
    VAR R : REAL;
    BEGIN
      R := 1.0;
               R      WRITE ((IR):6:3);
                I{      WRITE ((RI):6:3);}
    END;

BEGIN
  WRITELN ('Done.');
END.



      Compiler -- .odat.  Sizes Don't Match with DEBUG3.17  Compiler -- .odat.  Sizes Don't Match with DEBUG

When compiling an [OVERLAID] module with and without the DEBUG switch,
the odat p-sect sizes did not match.
                                                                Page 5


      Compiler -- Undefined FOR Variable Causes Abort3.18  Compiler -- Undefined FOR Variable Causes Abort

If a FOR statement using an undefined control variable  was  a  simple
statement  THEN part of an IF statement with a non-constant condition,
or if that FOR statement immediately followed a statement missing  its
ending  semicolon,  compilation would abort with a memory access error
in VMS or RSX.



      Compiler -- Abort Caused by Large Routine3.19  Compiler -- Abort Caused by Large Routine

When compiling a large program, the compiler (VMS  only)  would  abort
with the error message:

%PAS-F-ARRINDVAL, array index value is out of range

The correct error message is:

?PASCAL-F-CACHE overflow in ...

The incorrect error message occurred because two internal arrays  were
not declared properly.



      Compiler -- OPEN with UPDATE or DIRECT Not Diagnosed3.20  Compiler -- OPEN with UPDATE or DIRECT Not Diagnosed

The illegal OPENing of a TEXT file with DIRECT  or  UPDATE  accessmode
would  not  be  diagnosed.   The  following program did not generate a
compilation error.
VAR
  textfile: TEXT;

BEGIN
  open(textfile, 'file.fil', accessmode := direct);
  open(textfile, 'file.fil', accessmode := update);
END.



      OTS -- Problem Writing Long Integers3.21  OTS -- Problem Writing Long Integers

Long  integers  in  the  range   32768000..32768099   were   displayed
incorrectly.



      OTS -- Problem with CONNECTINTERRUPT3.22  OTS -- Problem with CONNECTINTERRUPT

In some cases, a  call  to  CONNECTINTERRUPT  would  not  function  as
desired  --  the PIC indicator would erroneously be changed from FALSE
to TRUE.
                                                                Page 6


      Writing REAL Numbers3.23  Writing REAL Numbers

V5.1 would  display  a  REAL  number  according  to  the  field  width
specified,  unless  the  nondecimal portion of the number exceeded the
field width.  In V2.0,  the  displaying  of  the  REAL  number  always
included  an additional space to the left of the number.  That problem
was fixed in V2.1 but not included in the V2.1 Release Notes.



      PASDBG -- INTERRUPT Command Damaged3.24  PASDBG -- INTERRUPT Command Damaged

The PASDBG command 'interrupt' as in "interrupt from %o300" only works
in the form 'inter' without the 'rupt' as in "inter from %o300".



      PASDBG -- EXAMINE SETS Broken3.25  PASDBG -- EXAMINE SETS Broken

When examining sets, PASDBG reports erroneous contents  and  sometimes
crashes.



      PASDBG -- Optional ':' in DEPOSIT Causes Error3.26  PASDBG -- Optional ':' in DEPOSIT Causes Error

Doing a deposit with PASDBG  using  the  optional  ':='  form  of  the
command as in "DEPOSIT turkey := true" produced an error.



      RSX/VMS RELOC Corrupts .PIM When Requesting a Wide Map3.27  RSX/VMS RELOC Corrupts .PIM When Requesting a Wide Map

Requesting a wide map from RELOC caused both an  invalid  map  and  an
invalid .PIM file to be generated.



      Two Arguments Reversed in MACRO MAPW$ Primitive3.28  Two Arguments Reversed in MACRO MAPW$ Primitive

Two of the arguments passed to the kernel for the MACRO-11 versions of
the  MAPW$  primitive  were  reversed  in  the argument block that was
passed to the kernel.  The opt and len arguments were reversed,  which
caused  unpredictable  results  and  possible  mmu  faults  within the
primitive.  This was a problem for all three versions ($, $C, and  $P)
of  the  MAPW$  primitive.   (The  Pascal  MAPWINDOW procedure was not
affected.)



      FPU=FPP Was Not Permitted in PROCESSOR Macro3.29  FPU=FPP Was Not Permitted in PROCESSOR Macro

The valid arguments for the FPP argument in the PROCESSOR  macro  were
FP11,  FIS, and FPA.  However, in the discussion about the TRAPS macro
on p 4-24 of the Runtime Services Manual, FPU=FPP was used by  mistake
instead of FPU=FP11.  The user got no error in specifying FPU=FPP, but
did not get the FPP trap processor.
                                                                Page 7


Since FPP is used  in  several  other  places  in  MicroPower,  a  new
argument, FPU=FPP, that is equivalent to FPU=FP11 is available.



      Problems with Names -- Logical and Shared Region3.30  Problems with Names -- Logical and Shared Region

There were three problems with names for logicals and  shared  regions
if they were defined in the kernel configuration file.  They were:

     1.  Specified names having fewer than  six  characters  and  that
         were  not  padded  with  blanks  by the user were incorrectly
         padded with nulls (octal 0's) instead of blanks.

     2.  Characters in shared region names sometimes were converted to
         uppercase when they were specified in lowercase by the user.

     3.  Names that were more than six characters long were truncated.
         There was no indication of this to the user.

You will now get a MACRO-11  Assembler  error  if  any  logical  name,
shared  region  name,  or static process name (specified in the DFSPC$
macro) contains more than six characters.



      Simplification of User Interface to QD Driver3.31  Simplification of User Interface to QD Driver

The  QD  driver  interface  routines  $DMATRANSFER,  $DMASEARCH,   and
$DMASEARCHTRANSFER  have  been changed to simplify the user interface.
If the DMA$VIRTUAL option (new for V2.3) is specified,  the  interface
routine  or  the  driver  converts  the  virtual address to a physical
address, if necessary.



      Complex Primitives and Sleep Not Timing Out3.32  Complex Primitives and Sleep Not Timing Out

Complex primitives and sleeping processes would sometimes not time out
as  expected.   This  was  caused  by  a  bug  in  CLKISR.MAC.  If the
expiration counter timed out while the condition  that  satisfied  the
WAITANY  was  in  the  fork  queue, the WAITANY processing would occur
while the CLKISR was in the fork queue behind  it.   When  the  CLKISR
woke up, if that was the only process that timed out, the CLKISR would
notice that there was no one to wake up.  It then would check  to  see
if there were any processes still in the queue.  If at that time there
were other processes waiting in the queue, the CLKISR wouldn't  notice
and  would  set the expiration counter for the next process timeout to
77777 incorrectly.  This problem would occur because the  pointer  for
the  check of whether there were other processes in the queue would be
incorrect.
                                                                Page 8


      IEEE C-I-C Not Talker3.33  IEEE C-I-C Not Talker

The controller in charge (C-I-C) could not also be  a  talker  on  the
IEEE bus.



      TON Auxiliary Command Now Works3.34  TON Auxiliary Command Now Works

The IEEE (XE) driver did not work correctly when  the  user  issued  a
'TON' auxiliary command.



      MP/P-VMS MPSETUP.COM3.35  MP/P-VMS MPSETUP.COM

The MP/P-VMS file MPSETUP.COM  did  not  have  a  symbol  for  running
MKBOOT.EXE.  MPSETUP.COM now has the symbol MPMKBOOT.



      RSX MPBUILD Problems with .MAC Extensions3.36  RSX MPBUILD Problems with .MAC Extensions

With only  the  RSX  version  of  MPBUILD,  there  were  two  problems
involving default extensions on files:

     1.  If, in response  to  the  User  process  name  question,  you
         specified  /MAC  without  a  file extension, MPBUILD gave the
         file the extension .PAS instead of  .MAC.   This  caused  the
         assembler  line  in  the  command  file  to  fail because the
         assembler could not find the file xxxxxx.PAS.

     2.  If, in response to  the  Driver  prefix  file  question,  you
         specified  a  file name having no extension and you then said
         you wanted to edit the file, MPBUILD attempted  to  open  the
         file  with  no extension, which caused EDT to open a new file
         and report "input file not found".



      MP/P-RSX Kits -- Errors in HELP Text3.37  MP/P-RSX Kits -- Errors in HELP Text

The MP/P-RSX help text had the following two errors:
