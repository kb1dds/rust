`LbSHAREplus V3.0	
`Ls Impact notes`}

System STB	SHAREplus V3.0 supplies a new system STB (SY:SHARE.OBJ). Any
		programs linked with the previous STB need to be rebuilt with
		the new STB.

Kernel size	The SHAREplus kernel occupies seven blocks more memory.

Pool size	A little more pool space is available in this release.

SHARE.COM	Make a backup copy of your version of SHARE.COM before copying
		the distribution kit to your system disk.

SHAPE		Two new SHAPE options are implemented:
  KERNEL`_DEBUG	Enables or disables built-in bootstrap debugger.
  MEMORY`_LIMIT	Sets the maximum memory size in kilowords.

Devices		The HANDLR utility may be used to define device defaults. HANDLR
		defaults take precedence over DCL commands unless the /NODEFAULT
		option is used.

Terminal	
  /NOTTSYNC	Is now supported - it was previously ignored

Logical names	The following system logical names are now built-in:
		WF=SYS, MAI=SYS, NOD=BOO, HOM=DKo	

`Ls Overview	`}

Documentation	The documentation kit has been fully revised.

Help		The HELP utility and library have been rewritten. The new
		library (SHARE.HLB) includes more information and better
		separation between normal usage and the rarer options. Unused
		functionality is not documented. In general the new HELP library
		is more accurate than the documentation kit.

Help compiler	A HELP compiler is supplied with minimal documentation. Contact
		us if you require further documentation.

Command editor	The [down] key recalls commands down-screen

RT-11		Realtime program requests .DEVICE, .PROTECT, .UNPROTECT
		MQ: supports RT-11 message queue operations
IEEE		IB: handler supports RT-11 IEEE bus library

F11 & F11A	A new F11 utility reads RSX, VMS and RT-11 disks. This method
		tends to work better than the F11A ACP.

RSX 		The RSX emulator is supplied with the kit but not supported.
		Only base-line versions of RSX tasks tend to function.

TSX		The TSX emulator has not been updated. The TSX feature is used
		mainly to support DBL programs.

Removed		CAMERA.SAV, VU.SYS, VUX.SYS

Renamed		MBX.SYS to MBP.SYS, FA.SYS to FAP.SYS	

Replaced	HELP.SAV

Added		F11.SAV		IBP.SYS		HLPCOM.SAV	MQP.SYS
		SHARE.HLB	VALUE.SAV	UDK.SAV
`Sl=28`.
`LbSHAREplus V3.0	
`Ls Documentation	`}

New kit		A new documentation kit is supplied with the V3.0 kit.

HELP		The HELP program and library have been fully rewritten. HELP
		tends to be more accurate than the documentation kit. The new
		HELP library includes information on utilities, control keys,
		system calls and undocumented commands.

Undocumented	The following items are not documented:
  UCL		The UCL command - see DCL below
  SHAPE		The KERNEL`_DEBUG option is not documented
  INSTALL
   /NODEFAULT	Does not use default handler settings setup by HANDLR.

RECORD-eleven	Replace all references to '7-word area' with '10-word area'.

`Ls DCL	`}

Labels 		Labels may be preceded by "$" or "$ ".

ASSIGN		Supports multiple equivalence names.

ATTACH
DETACH		Terminal attach usually results in [ctrl/t] display. This
		display is inhibited if SET TERMINAL/HALFDUPLEX enabled. Used
		for automatic remote logins.

BACKUP		Minor fixes

COMPILE/HELP	Runs SHAREplus HELP compiler.

CONNECT		New command. Connect TPnet nodes.

CLOSE LOG	Minor fixes.

IND		Minor fixes.

JOIN		New command. Attach remote TPnet terminal.

MOUNT		Supports logical names of virtual volumes.

SET DEVICE	
  /[NO]22BIT	Sets/clears device/unit 22-bit status.
  /UNIT 	Modifies unit record only.
  /DEVICE	Modifies device only.

SET HOST	New command. Attach remote TPnet terminal.

SET PROGRAM
  /REALTIME	Sets REALTIME flag permitting .PROTECT/.UNPROTECT/.DEVICE.

SHOW NETWORK	New command. Display TPnet node status.

SHOW PROCESS
  /LOGGER	Display redesigned.

UCL		This is an undocumented command:
		UCL symbol :== string 	defines UCL variable
		UCL/LIST		lists UCL commands
		UCL			runs UCL
`Sl=28`.
`LbSHAREplus V3.0	
`Ls Terminal	`}

/HAZELTINE	Supported. Returns FT1 type.

/NOTTSYNC	This option is now supported - it was previously ignored.

/HALFDUP	This option is used to suppress [ctrl/t] display on ATTACH.

Command editor	The [down] key is now used to recall down-screen. The following
		changes were required to support this feature:

		[end-line]	store, reset up-screen origin
		[up]		recall-up-screen, reset down-screen-origin
		[down]		recall-down-screen
		[gold][up]	store saved line
		[gold][down]	recall saved line

VT200 & VT300	The command editor supports 8-bit control sequences.

TT: & aborts	Various problems were fixed for aborted terminal operations.

UDK		This utility defines user defined function keys.


`Ls Kernel 	`}

$SCHED		New system service - forces scheduler pass.

$STSIG		New service - specifies signal ast address.

$SIGNAL		New service - signals another process.

.PROTECT	
.UNPROTECT	Support added to handle simple realtime applications.
		The user-space vector specifies the address of an ISR.
		The ISR runs in user-mode, at priority zero.
		A .RSUM is issued for the process if the user vector is null.
		The program requires CMKRNL and must be SET PROGRAM/REALTIME.
		.DEVICE (or $DCLEXH) must clear CSR enables.

.DEVICE		Programs must have CMKRNL and must be SET PROGRAM/REALTIME.
		Only addresses in the I/O page are modified. Invalid addresses
		cause the remainder of the list to be ignored.

EVA		New .GTJB EVA call BAS returns base page of process.

EMT 373		SHAREplus system services use EMT 373. This could conflict with
		a later release of SHAREplus. SHAREplus now clears bit 200 of
		EMT 373 subcodes which provides a compatibility path for the
		future.

I/O mapping	All kernel mode I/O transfers may now use mapped memory. User-
		mode transfers are handled via MMU registers if the program is
		set /MMU (with SET PROGRAM).

Bootstrap	SHAREplus does not report a warning when booting from an RT11S
		device. This supports network bootstrap operations.

Debugger	The kernel includes a small debugger that can be used to catch
		problems during system startup. The debugger is usually
		disabled. Use the SHAPE KERNEL`_DEBUGGER option to enable the
		debugger. The kernel debugger uses pool space.
`Sl=28`.
`LbSHAREplus V3.0	
`Ls Features`}

MAILER		Network connect specifies logout on disconnect Network input
		specifies NOWAIT condition

PLAS		Small windows at end of region were incorrectly handled.
		Virtual SETTOP only performed when VIRT$ bit set in JSW.
		Automatic window unmap operation could corrupt kernel.

TRACE		Displays .PRINT requests if DISPLAY/EVERYTHING
		TRACE now checks for invalid subcodes internally.

TSX		Uses requested size in TSX TS$SSZ STTOP. request.

`Ls Handlers	`}

HANDLR		HANDLR may be used to define default installation settings.
		All HAMMONDsoftware handlers are configured with HANDLR.

Suffixes	SHAREplus V3.0 uses the following conventions:
 ddP.SYS	A SHAREplus only handler. This is the default.
 ddX.SYS	An RT-11/XM handler. The default for /MAPPED.
 dd.SYS		An RT-11/SJ or RT-11/FB handler. Default for /UNMAPPED.

Fetch/Release	Support has been completed for RT-11 V5.4 .DRPTR routines.

IBP.SYS		A new handler. Basic support for RT-11 IEEE library under
		SHAREplus. This handler is unsupported.

MQP.SYS		A new handler. Compatible with RT-11 Message Queue handler.
		MQP.SYS has extensions for SHAREplus.

TK.SYS		A new handler. Uses a terminal output port in place of a line
		frequency clock.

MU:		/EXTERNAL support fixed.
MB: & TT:	Various problems with aborts and [ctrl/z] fixed.
