KPS: - RUST KEYPAD editor

	KEYPAD.SAV is the default RUST text file editor

	o Compatible subset of the RT-11 KED editor
	o Supports RT-11 and RSX-11 text files
	o Supports a very limited HTML mode

	The current implementation will be too slow for large files
	on systems with slow disks.

	KEYPAD has been tested internally only. It must have bugs
	for an experienced user (I'm a novice).
