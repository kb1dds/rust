;	MACRO has problems including some source files.
;	The solution is to embed the entire source in a
;	macro and then invoke the macro.

inc$c=1			; signal to CTS:RTINI.MAC that we're .INCLUDing
			;
.macro rtini		; embed CTS:RTINI.MAC in macro RTINI
.include "cts:rtini.mac";
.endm			;

rtini			; invoke RTINI

.end
