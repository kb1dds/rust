==Feature Drivers==

Feature drivers use device drivers as a vehicle to implement additional system features. For example, the SL driver implements a single-line command editor. These drivers do not accept the usual open/close and read/write scenarios of storage and port drivers.

Loading a feature driver usually activates its functionality. Likewise, unloading or removing a feature driver is sufficient to deactivate the functionality.

Many of these drivers are RUST/SJ-specific. That's because RUST/XM implements loadable FEATURES which are a better way to extend the kernel with additional functionality.
