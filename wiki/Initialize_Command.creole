[[code]]
----
**/INITIALIZE device**

  Initializes a BACKUP volume.

----
**/BADBLOCKS[:RET]**

  Creates .BAD files to cover bad blocks.

  Existing .BAD files are retained with the :RETAIN keyword.

----
**/EXTRA=n**

  Specifies the extra words per entry for RT-11 disks.

----
**/FILE=in-file**

  Creates a magtape bootstrap with the specified file.

----
**/INTERCHANGE**

  Initializes an IBM interchange floppy.

  After the INIT completes you must delete the dummy data file:
[[code format="text"]]
  . delete ddu:data/interchange
[[code]]
* Interchange floppies must be single density (see FORMAT).
* Filetypes are two characters. These are not MS-DOS diskettes.
* RT-11 FILEX.SAV is required.

----
**/[NO]QUERY**

  Does (not) request confirmation of the operation.

  A reply beginning with 'Y' (for Yes) confirms the operation.    
  Anything else denies the operation.     

----
**/REPLACE[:RETAIN]**

  Creates a bad block replacement table.

  RUST Initialize does not support /REPLACE. Use RT-11 DUP.

  Use the :RETAIN keyword to retain the existing replacement table.

  This option applies only to RK06, RK07, RL01 and RL02 disks.

----
**/RESTORE**

  Restores an RT-11 directory.

  Use this if you initialized an RT-11 directory by mistake. You can use   /RESTORE only if no files have been transferred to the volume since the time   it was initialized.

  Use COPY/BOOT to restore the boot blocks.

----
**/RT11X**

  Initializes a RUST/XM RT11X volume.

  RT11X adds a UIC and protection mask to RT-11 directory entries.

----
**/SEGMENTS=n**

  Specifies the number of RT-11 directory segments.
  The default is dependent on the size of the disk
  The valid range is 1 to 31.

----
**/VOLUMEID[:ONLY]**

  Writes the volume and owner ID of the volume.

  The system prompts you for the new volume and owner IDs.

  Use the :ONLY keyword to change the IDs without initializing the volume.

**Volume ID**       
    Upto 12 characters for a disk; upto 6 characters for a magtape. 
    RUST recognises only the first 6 characters.
**Owner ID**
    Upto 12 characters for a disk; upto 10 characters for a magtape.        
    The owner ID is usually the volume UIC, for example: [100,2].   

----
**/WAIT**

  Permits the operation to take place on a single volume.
  The system tells you which volumes to mount during the operation.

* RUST VUP does not support this option for all operations.
