==LIBRARY library-file [in-files]==

  Creates, updates and inspects libraries.

**Library-file**    
    The library file specification.
    The default library file type is .OBJ.
**In-files**
    Upto five input file specifications.
    The default input file type is .OBJ.

*  Use the /MACRO option to create MACRO libraries.

----
**/ALL**

  Places all globals, including absolute, in the directory.

----
**/CREATE**

  Creates a new library.

----
**/DELETE library**

  Deletes modules from the library.

  The system requests the names of modules to be deleted.
  Terminate the list with a blank line.

----
**/EXTRACT**

  Extracts modules from library.

  The system prompts you for the names of modules (or global symbols).
  Terminate the list with a blank line.

  A file is created with the name of the module and file type .OBJ.       

----
**/INSERT**

  Inserts modules into the library.
    This is the default

----
**/[NO]LIST[=out-file]**

  Creates a listing file.
  The default is /NOLIST.

**Out-file**
    A single output file specification.
    The default device is LP:

**/ALLOCATE=size**
  Allocates space for the output file.    
  Unused space is returned to the system when the file is closed.
  Use the value -1 to allocate the largest space available on device.
  This option must follow the output file specification concerned.

----
**/MACRO library in-files**

  Creates a MACRO library.

* You cannot update MACRO libraries.
* Use the [[MLB_Utility|MLB]] utility to list MACRO libraries.  

**Library-file**    
    The library file specification.
    The default library file type is .MAC.
**In-files**
    Upto five input file specifications.
    The default input file type is .MLB.

----
**/MODULES**

  Includes module names in the directory.

----
**/MULTIPLE**

  Permits multiple definitions of a global symbol.

----
**/[NO]OBJECT[=out-file]**

  Suppresses the output library or defines its name.
  The default is /OBJECT, which creates a new version of the input library.

**Out-file**
    A single output file specification.
    The default output file type is .OBJ.

**/ALLOCATE=size**
  Allocates space for the output file.    
  Unused space is returned to the system when the file is closed.
  Use the value -1 to allocate the largest space available on device.
  This option must follow the output file specification concerned.

----
**/PROMPT**

  Prompts for additional input files.

  Terminate the list with //.
[[code format="text"]]
  .library/prompt modlib a,b,c,d,e,f      
  *g,h,i  
  *//     
[[code]]
----
**/PSECTS**

  Includes program section (PSECT) names in the directory.

----
**/REMOVE**

  Removes global symbols from the library.

  The system prompts for the names to be removed.
  Terminate the list with a blank line.

  A subsequent update operation makes the global symbols visible again.

----
**REPLACE** 

  Replace modules in the library.

  This option must follow each module to which it applies.        
[[code format="text"]]
  .library mathlb mfunct/replace
[[code]]
----
**/UPDATE**

  Combines the /INSERT and /REPLACE functions.

  This option must follow each module to which it applies.        
[[code format="text"]]
