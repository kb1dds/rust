==Protection Overview==

**RUST/SJ**
RUST/SJ is a largely unprotected system by design. File protection is limited to the RT-11 deletion flag. System protection is limited to a number of warnings.

An earlier version of the system did implement a protected turn-key environment.

**RUST/XM**
RUST/XM implements the RSX/VMS UIC-based file protection model and the VMS process privilege model.
