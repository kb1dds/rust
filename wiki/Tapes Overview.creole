==Tapes Overview==

RUST provides no magtape drivers, however, standard RT-11 magtape drivers should be compatible with RUST.

RUST does provide a TU58 cassette tape driver. The principal goal of the driver is to implement a serial-line connection to a remote Windows system with a disk server. The RUST TU58 driver has not been tested with real hardware.
